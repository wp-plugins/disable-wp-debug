This plugin is intended for developers. It disables output from WP_DEBUG.

== Description ==

If you are a WordPress plugin or theme developer, you know you should be running with WP_DEBUG set to true
in the wp-config.php file. But apparently other developers don't, and you end up with PHP error output
generated by these other plugins.

This plugin will make your life a bit easier. Leave WP_DEBUG set to true like you should. Then if you need to do
some testing with a different theme or plugin that is generateing PHP errors, you can disable that output
with a simple click in this plugin instead of having to edit your wp-config.php file.

== Installation ==

It is easiest to use the Plugin Add Plugin page, but you can do it manually, too:

1. Download the plugin archive and expand it
2. Upload the weaver-ii-theme-switcher.php file to your wp-content/plugins/weaver-ii-theme-switcher directory
3. Go to the Plugins page in your WordPress Administration area and click 'Activate' for Weaver II Theme Switcher.
